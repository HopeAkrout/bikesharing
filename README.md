## Overview

The analysis done on NYC Citibikes was to determine the dynamics of running such a business and how it might translate when opening something similar in Des Moines, Iowa.  Though New York City has an estimated population of 8,467,513 residents and 32.9 million tourists, while Des Moines only has a population of 212,031 and the last reported visitor report was 13.7 million in 2016 (pre-pandemic), it's possible to use the data as a base number to scale. For example, instead of 13,436 bikes, a company in Des Moines could deploy 350 bikes and purchase more if the business finds that demand is high enough.

## Results

As seen in the NYC Citibike Analysis, bikes are checked out for only a short amount of time, the peak being 6 minutes, with an average of 3 - 10 minutes. Without more information, this could be an indicator that the bikes are being used for short trips either between tourist destinations or from home to work and back. This allows for less bikes to be necessary in the fleet to meet a high demand of customers.

A further look into checkout times shows that the customers are mainly male. This can help with target advertising. Trips by hour and further broken down by gender show that peak hours are between 8:00-9:00 am and 4:00-8:00 pm when vehicular traffic is at its peak and biking is a quicker way to get around the city, and that Thursday-Saturday are the busiest days for Citibike.

In looking at the difference between Customer and Subscriber, we're able to see that this service is utilized heavily by subscribers, indicating this is a service being used by either residents or long-term tourists.  It's an encouraging indication that opening a business elsewhere will rely more on the city's population rather than the number of tourists coming to the city annually.  Especially with Des Moines numbers and the more volatile tourism industry post-COVID, resident driven revenue is a safer business to invest in.

A look at the age of customers can also be a good data point to focus on with target advertising. Seeing that the highest percentage of customers and subscribers are around the age of fifty and the next highest percentage is in the age bracket of 25-35 years old, it would be interesting to gather more data on why these two age groups choose Citibike over taxis or other forms of transportation.

Finally, in looking at the top starting and ending locations, it's not as spread out over the city as might initially be expected but focuses more heavily over a condensed section of the city.  This is helpful to know when setting up locations to checkout and return bikes and how many to distribute to each location.

## Summary

Data shows that bike sharing can be a successful business venture and it wouldn't be too difficult for someone familiar with Des Moines to set up a company with checkout sites that are more populated and likely to have a customer base more likely to choose checking out a bike for their commute to work, a tourist attraction, or for pleasure rather than another form of transportation.  However, using NYC data is risky as there is such a high population and with a set of circumstances and city culture that would make a bike sharing business successful, while in other cities and smaller towns that data won't necessarily translate well, even if one takes into account how much would need to be scaled to plan properly for a startup.  It would take a lot more research into the city of Des Moines regarding weather, road conditions, biking culture and a viable market need not currently being met in order to confidently state that a new bike sharing business would be successful.
